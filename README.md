# Face Wars

## Face wars is a single player game that uses Face++ API

What it does is: basically, after you upload a facial image, it sends it to a facial recognition api (Face++) that reads the emotions of the face and gives it a score based on the emotions value. 
It then takes the score of the emotional attributes and gives your character it's stats, based on it's score. You then get matched with a random face from our database, and the battle begins!
